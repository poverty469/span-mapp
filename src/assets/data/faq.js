                question: 'Why do you use the Self Sufficiency Standard as well as the Federal Poverty Level Don`t they mean the same thing?',
                answer: 'Great question! The Federal Povery Level (FPL) and the Self Sufficiency Standard (SSS) are two separate measurements that tell two very different stories. The FPL is a measurement that the federal government uses to determine who is eligible for assistance programs. The FPL is updated yearly based on information gathered by the US Census Bureau. However, the federal government is using the same standards and guidelines to determine the FPL that it did when it was created in the 1960s, that do not account for modern economic realities. The SSS was created as answer to the shortcomings of the FPL, and takes a variety of variables, such as geographic differences and ages of children, into account when calculating the income level that households much reach to meet their basic needs. We included the FPL in this map because it is a very real measure that determines who is eligible for what basic needs assistance programs, and we also included the SSS as a measure that illuminates lived economic experience.'
